## About Scorpio

Scorpio is a web application with expressive, elegant and simple project that helps to assign a cab driver to a customer on demand. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Scorpio takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many uberisation projects, such as:

- Auto assigning of drivers to trips.
- Creating and maintaining trip records of customers.
- Multiple User Authentication using [sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [rate limiting](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) through [caching].
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).

Scorpio is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
